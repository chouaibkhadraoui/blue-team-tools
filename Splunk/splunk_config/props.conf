# This file specifies how Splunk should handle incoming log data.
# It defines how events should be broken into separate lines, how timestamps are extracted, 
# and how log data is parsed to create meaningful fields for further analysis.

# Example: Defines 'syslog' sourcetype for syslog log data.

LINE_BREAKER = (\r\n|\n)    # Breaks events into separate lines at newline characters
TIME_FORMAT = %b %d %H:%M:%S  # Defines the timestamp format (e.g., 'Jan 01 12:00:00')
TIME_PREFIX = ^              # Tells Splunk to search for the timestamp at the beginning of each line
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false     # Ensures each line is treated as a separate event (no merging)
