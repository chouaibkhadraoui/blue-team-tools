# This file allows you to apply transformations to the incoming data.
# You can use it to rename fields, extract additional information from logs, filter out unnecessary data,
# or mask sensitive information before itâ€™s indexed in Splunk.

# Example 1: Extracting additional fields from security logs.

[extract_user_ip]
SOURCE_KEY = _raw                           # Specifies that the transformation applies to raw log data
REGEX = user=(\w+)\s+ip=(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+) # Regular expression to extract user and IP address
FORMAT = user::$1 ip::$2                    # Assigns extracted values to fields 'user' and 'ip'

# Example 2: Masking sensitive data (e.g., passwords).

[mask_sensitive_data]
REGEX = (password\s*=\s*)\S+                 # Regular expression to identify password fields
REPLACEMENT = password=****                  # Replaces passwords with '****' to mask sensitive data
